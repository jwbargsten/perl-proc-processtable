COMMENT
=======

FreeBSD 5.X not mounting /proc by default. Procfs is vulnerable system and
its use is not recommended in future. In addition, mapping processes space
to /proc is not correct (at least, in 7 of 7 my freebsd servers with
FreeBSD5 installed).

So, I decided to write this code. This module works via the kvm system.

Any comments please send to king2@kaluga.ru.
