  only shows info for current process.

0.41 2006-06-30
  -Port to openbsd from <bsd@openbsd.rutgers.edu>. Fix for
  EOVERFLOW in HPUX 11.11 from <alan.martin@oracle.com>
  (rt.cpan.org ticket #18932). Module now requires perl 5.6 as
  suggested by <rdusong@tique.org> (rt.cpan.org ticket
  #15279). Patches from <reini.urban@gmail.com> for killall to
  use fname if cmndline is not defined and rename PID_ZOMBIE to
  PID_ORPHANED under cygwin (rt.cpan.org ticket #14837,
  #14836). Fixed empty pctmem bug on linux due to change in
  format of /proc/meminfo (hopefully this format is stable
  now??).

0.40 2005-07-10
  -Added patch for support of FreeBSD-5 via kvm from Oleg King
  <king2@kaluga.ru>. Added contrib directory and pswait script
  from dominix <dominix@despammed.com>. Patch from Steve Linn
  <steve@rhythm.com> to handle processes larger than 2GB. Added
  jiffies-to-microseconds patch for linux from Jason A. Smith

  Fix for FC4 gcc-4 buffer overrun complaint.

0.39 2003-10-03
  -Project is now hosted on SourceForge. Patch from Aaron
  Sherman <ajs@ajs.com> from rt.cpan.org ticket #2578 to add a
  warn function ppt_warn() instead of sending errors to stderr;
  changed linux, bsdi and aix. Added ppt_croak and updated
  PORTING docs. Added port to Darwin from Tom Wyant
  <twyant3@comcast.net>. Added port to Nonstop-UX from Mike
  Steinert <mike.steinert@motorola.com>. Patch from
  James.FitzGibbon <James.FitzGibbon@target.com> for AIX 5.1
  command line args. Added note to README.dec_osf that root
  access is required.

0.38 2002-12-06
  -Fixed my omission of new AIX files from MANIFEST. Patch from
  Tim Cutts <tjrc@sanger.ac.uk> for Tru64 clusters.

0.37 2002-11-08
  -Patch from Philip Molter <philip@texas.net> to fix typo in
  Solaris.c.

0.36 2002-11-05 23:04:12
  -Patch for documentation typo for Killfam.pm from Mike Castle
  <dalgoda@ix.netcom.com>. Patch for AIX v4.2 from James
  FitzGibbon <james@ehlo.com> to take advantage of newer OS API;
  this also required addition of a new return type (long-long,
  specified as "j") to ProcessTable.xs. Patch to add new field
  "numthr" for number of threads for Solaris from Joseph
  Cavanaugh <Joseph.Cavanaugh@FMR.COM>. Patch for linux compiler
  warnings from Marcus Crafter <crafterm@osa.de>. Changed HPUX
  "cmd" field to "cmndline" for consistency with other ports at
  the suggestion of Craig Cook <cncook@gene.COM>. Windows port
  via Cygwin from J Robert Ray <jrray@jrray.org>. Patch for
  multithread support under Solaris from Kong Li
  <Kong.Li@netiq.com>. Patch for File::Find::prune tty mapping
  buglet from <jon@jjb.demon.co.uk>. Changed behavior of
  store_ttydev() in ProcessTable.xs to insert an empty string
  for processes that don't have a tty, instead of having it
  return undef. I *think* this will fix a problem reported on
  HPUX by H.Merijn Brand <h.m.brand@hccnet.nl>. Changed ttynums
  to be treated as unsigned to fix occasional negative ttynum
  bug reported by Daniel Berger <djberge@qwest.com>.

0.35 2002-07-01 11:24:43
  -Patch from Thomas Glanzmann <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>
  to fix starttime overflow bug on linux. This should also fix
  multiprocessor starttime bugs. He says there is another
  overflow after 25 days of uptime though :(
  Nearly identical patches from Doug Lewis
  <dlewis@exchange.webmd.net> and Jan L. Peterson
  <jlp@flipdog.com> to fix taint problem. Patch from Peter van
  Hooft <hooft@natlab.research.philips.com> to allow non-root
  users to list processes on IRIX.


0.34 2002-02-24 21:55:07
  -Corrected documentation type pointed out by Marcus Crafter
  <crafterm@osa.de>. Fix for JIFFIES_TO_MICROSECONDS potential
  int overflow on linux from Stephen Pillinger
  <S.M.Pillinger@cs.bham.ac.uk>. Patch for File::Find routine
  on AIX (broken POSIX?) from H.Merijn Brand
  <h.m.brand@hccnet.nl>. Big linux code cleanup patch from
  Anthony Higa <anthony@squareusa.com>; I *think* this also
  fixes the linux-ppc problem reported by Marcus Crafter.


0.33 2001-10-10 15:50:17
  -Fixed Solaris large file environment problem (by turning off
  large file environment CCFLAGS!). Patches from Chris Adams
  <cmadams@hiwaay.net> for TTYs with device number(s) zero and
  Digital Unix table() call to read processes. Added
  README.taint for workarounds for perl -T. Changed umask for
  644 permissions for /tmp/TTYDEVS.

0.32 2001-08-19 04:45:25
  -SunOS port from Shawn Clifford <shawn.a.clifford@lmco.com>.
  Patch from Thomas Linden <tom@daemon.de> for additional Linux
  fields. Patch for bsdi from Nicolas Belan <belan@matranet.com>
  to add cmndline.

0.31 2001-06-01 08:27:03
  - Removed bogus test code line from os/Linux.c that was opening
    "/tmp/tedddi".

0.30 2001-03-04 05:05:26
  - Patch from David Good <dgood@stratasource.com> for 32-bit HPUX 11.0 support
    via the 64-bit interface. Port to Unixware 7.x from Martin Lucina
    <mato@catalyst.net.nz>. Upgraded status to beta :)

0.29 2001-01-09 07:36:13
  - Patch from Wolfgang Friebel <Wolfgang.Friebel@desy.de> for os/HPUX.c to
    make the time method return useful values. Patch from Adrian Phillips
    <tandem@dnmi.no> to fix AIX cmndline field. Patch from Tryggvi Farestveit
    <tryggvi@firmanet.is> to fix bug in cmndline under Linux. Killfam.pm module
    from Steve Lidie <sol0@Lehigh.EDU>.

0.28 2000-08-14 16:31:43
  - Patch from Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de> to make test script -w
    clean.

0.27 2000-06-29 08:27:23
  - Added patch for converting jiffies to microseconds in linux from Philip
    Gwyn <fil@pied.nu>. Added patch from Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de>
    for FreeBSD and to make Storable optional.

0.26 2000-02-11 16:43:48
  - Added Proc::Killall from Aaraon Sherman <ajs@ajs.com>.

0.25 2000-02-03 11:20:27
  - Added patch from F. Buirey <f.buirey@saprr.fr> for AIX SMP.

0.24 2000-01-20 08:00:30
  - Added patches from Noel Paul <NoelP@mincom.com> for dec_osf pctcpu and
    pctmem, and for IRIX for pctmem.

0.23 1999-11-01 08:32:54
  - Added patch from Dave Alden <alden@math.ohio-state.edu> for solaris "nice"
    and "onproc" fields.

0.22 1999-10-05 07:47:54
  - Bug fix for Solaris; nanosecond process times are only available on 2.6
    (and above?); this was causing the module to dump core on earlier systems.
    Also, size and rss appear to be in kilobytes, not pages in 2.6 and above
    (they are in pages in the struct prpsinfo in < 2.6, but also available
    directly as bytes).

0.21 1999-09-10 12:32:13
  - Bug fix; new "fields" method was crapping out on everything except
    Linux-Intel.

0.20 1999-09-08 22:27:28
  - Added "fields" method to module to return list of fields supported for the
    current architecture. This is implemented in a slightly kludgy way, since
    it needs to call the table method if the table method hasn't been called
    before, since only the table method knows the names of the fields. Also
    changed the test code to dump all the fields/values available for the
    current process table, instead of just dumping pids and "fname" which isn't
    supported on all architectures (though it should be). Added "example.pl"
    file which contains the same code.

0.19 1999-08-30 00:22:02
  - Reinstated 'OBJECT' argument in WriteMakefile in Makefile.PL since it was
    breaking the build on dec-osf, but this time with explicit object files to
    look for which seems to work, at least under Linux. Why this should be
    necessary is unclear. Added "fname" field to HPUX (was "cmd") for
    consistency with other ports and for new test. Added very basic
    "README.hpux". Added check in ProcessTable.pm to prune search tree for
    unreadable directories when finding TTY list; this was causing spurious
    errors during build on dec_osf since some directories under /dev are
    readable only by root.

0.18 1999-08-19 10:57:16
  - Fixed bug (at least for linux) in Makefile.PL that was causing
    ProcessTable.xs not to be converted to ProcessTable.c; this was carelessly
    introduced by me with integration of the port to dec_osf. Added port for
    netbsd from Peter Reich <pr@alles.prima.de>.

0.17 1999-08-19 10:57:16
  - Lost connection to ISP during upload to PAUSE, and PAUSE won't let me
    reload it so I have to increment the version number. Kind of annoying.

0.16 1999-08-09 22:59:46
  - Added nanosecond Solaris patch from Rolf Petter Halle <rph@nextel.no>.
    Added port for dec_osf from Bernhard Schmalhofer
    <Bernhard.Schmalhofer@fazi.de>, which included new version of test code as
    well. Added bsdi port from Sean Eskins <sean@gilasoft.com>.

0.15 1999-06-01 21:33:16
  - Added patch from Peter ? <hooft@natlab.research.philips.com> for IRIX
    version differences. There seems to be a lot of IRIX out there.

0.14 1999-05-14 06:30:15
  - Added port for IRIX from W. Phillip Moore <wpm@ms.com> in 0.13, but forgot
    to add files to MANIFEST and edit Changes (Duh). W. Phillip Moore's port
    also included a minor patch for Solaris to get the page size from the
    system.

0.12 1999-03-21 10:53:56
  - Hopefully the final fix for the sv_undef buglet.

0.11 1999-03-06 19:04:39
  - Fixed code that checked perl patchlevel version to check directly for
    definition of PL_sv_undef and define it as sv_undef if it's not there,
    since it's not clear what patchlevel we need to check for. Also fixed
    embarrassing and unnecessary call to close() a string in Solaris.c

0.10 1999-02-20 11:29:35
  - Added code to ProcessTable.xs to check perl patchlevel version and use
    either PL_sv_undef or sv_undef since lots of people are still using older
    versions of perl.

0.09 1999-02-19 23:23:53
  - Fixed bug in Linux.c, fopen() called without corresponding fclose. Added
    empty DESTROY subs to ProcessTable.pm and Process.pm to fix occasional
    problems with mod_perl. Changed all instances of sv_undef in
    ProcessTable.xs to PL_sv_undef to comply with new standard.

0.08 1999-02-04 00:35:53
  - Fixed bug in solaris hints file that was looking for a version of solaris
    returned by "uname -r" as > 2.5, when "uname -r" returns the "SunOS"
    version of 5.5. Fixed bug in linux module in which only the first field of
    the command line was getting passed in cmndline attribute.

0.07 1999-01-06 14:57:04
  - added FreeBSD port by Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de>.

0.06 1998-12-09 23:42:05
  - added HPUX port by Mike Romberg <romberg@fsl.noaa.gov>.

0.05 1998-12-09 18:47:39
  - fixed minor compilation problems for solaris. Changed rss to bytes on linux
    for consistency with solaris; also added "time" and "ctime" fields to linux
    for consistency. Updated documentation in Process.pm. Folded in AIX port by
    David Paquet <david-paquet@usa.net>.

0.04 1998-08-14 22:51:31
  - preliminary pre-alpha solaris support

0.03 1998-07-26 09:07:50
  - added argument to va_end to make linux-ppc work

0.01 1998-06-08 11:37:47
  - original version; created by h2xs 1.18
